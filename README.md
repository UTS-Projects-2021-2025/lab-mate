## Motivation for Lab Mate

Lab Mate came about because of our experience in computer science and maths labs
and tutorials. One goal every tutor strives for in computer science labs and
tutorials is to have a social bi-directional feedback stream. Here we list a few
common problems tutors face.

- In a classroom of 30 students, there is no way of knowing who has completed
  the activity, or who to give feedback to.
- Often no student wants to go up and 'present' a proof or solution. However,
  encouraging students to do this is important in subjects in and around maths.
- There is no centralised and systematic way to set timers and track activities.

Notice that each of these problems could be solved by a *combination* of google
drive, google docs, kahoot, etc. However, in the fast paced environment of a
tutorial, it is inefficient to setup each of these seperate tools.

## Using Lab Mate

*Note that Lab Mate utilises a email based authentication system, so if testing
is required, testing needs to be done on your actual phone with your email (5
minute mail should work though).*

Lab Mate is a highly synchronous app, so in order to use the application you
need to follow each step in specific order.
